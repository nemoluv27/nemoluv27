## 🧭 About Me
Cloud & DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience operating production-like infrastructure across AWS and GCP.  
I focus on **reliability, scalability, automation, and observability**, and I enjoy evolving systems incrementally to understand real-world trade-offs.

- Kubernetes-based platforms
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- CI/CD & GitOps workflows
- Monitoring, logging, and incident readiness
- Cost-aware and failure-oriented system design

## 🟢 Ongoing Project (2026 – Present)
# Evolving Kubernetes Platform

📅 **Jan 2026 – Present**  
🔁 **Status: Actively evolving**

> A continuously evolving Kubernetes-based platform project designed to explore real-world  
> DevOps and Platform Engineering practices through incremental changes and tooling migrations.

### 🎯 Project Goal
Build a production-like Kubernetes platform starting from local development and gradually evolving into a cloud-based, operationally controlled system by introducing:

- GitOps-based continuous delivery
- Kubernetes platform expansion (Local → AWS EKS)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Helm-based application and platform packaging
- Environment lifecycle automation (start/stop, cost control)
- Observability stack (metrics and logs)
- CI system evolution and build workflow automation
- Database migration and data layer evolution
- Scaling and performance experiments beyond CPU-based autoscaling

────────────────────────────────────────
Environment Shift (Intentional)

Due to temporary AWS usage constraints, all cloud resources were intentionally decommissioned.
The platform evolution continues locally to reinforce automation, observability,
and CI foundations before re-expanding to cloud environments.

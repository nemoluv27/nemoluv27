## 🧭 About Me
Cloud & DevOps Engineer with hands-on experience designing and operating production-like infrastructure across AWS and GCP.  
I focus on **reliability, scalability, automation, and observability**, and I enjoy iteratively improving systems through real-world experiments.

- Multi-cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP)
- Kubernetes-based platforms
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- CI/CD & GitOps workflows
- Monitoring, logging, and incident readiness

## 🚀 Core Project: Evolving Kubernetes Platform
> A continuously evolving platform project to explore real-world DevOps and Platform Engineering practices.

### 🎯 Project Goal
Build and iteratively improve a **production-like Kubernetes platform** starting from local development and gradually introducing enterprise-grade tooling and architecture.

---

### 🧩 Architecture (Current Focus)
- Local Kubernetes (Docker Desktop / kind)
- GitHub Actions → ArgoCD (GitOps)
- Prometheus, Loki, Grafana for observability
- External managed DB (Neon → MySQL migration planned)

---

### 🗺️ Project Roadmap & Progress
| Phase | Topic | Status |
|------|------|------|
| Phase 1 | Local Kubernetes setup (kind / Docker Desktop) | ✅ Completed |
| Phase 2 | CI with GitHub Actions | ✅ Completed |
| Phase 3 | GitOps deployment with ArgoCD | 🔄 In Progress |
| Phase 4 | Monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana) | ⏳ Planned |
| Phase 5 | Logging (Loki) | ⏳ Planned |
| Phase 6 | CI migration (GitHub Actions → Jenkins) | ⏳ Planned |
